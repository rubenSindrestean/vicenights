# Inventory System

- Display thirst, hunger and health (like on your UI from Behance)
- Your Pockets
- Your Backpack (with levels as well)
- I need like a default character that shows: hat, neck, hands, torso, legs, etc, so users can fast equip/unequip clothes. (this is only for clothes)
- Equipped
- Throw on the ground section.
- Fast access

# Crafting

This one is going to be pretty simple, and you can also take elements from the Inventory System.

- Your Items
- To Be Crafted Items (basically you can put some elements in here so you can test what it can come out)
- Crafting Result

# Weapons

- I need the following categories: Pistol, SMG, Automatic Rifle, Heavy, Sniper Rifle, Launchers, Throwables
- I need to have the possibility in the UI to upgrade the weapon: stock, magazine, silencers, scopes. 
- Some bars with damage, range, fire rate, accuracy and control.
- Here we can use the images from the Icon Pack for each weapon.
